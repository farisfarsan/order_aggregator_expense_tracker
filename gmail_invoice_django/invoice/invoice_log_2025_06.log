Portkey Virtual Keys








Hey FARIS,


Here's a quick run down on why you should create virtual keys for 
faris's


They're a way to manage your API access more securely - instead of using keys directly, you use these virtual keys. Think of them like disposable credit cards.


Here's how they help:




Easy key rotation
 without changing code


More control
 -  set budgets & rate limits


Better tracking
 - request attribution & usage monitoring




I know it might sound complicated, but it's actually super easy to set up. Look:




Once you've got your virtual key, using it is straightforward. Here's a quick example:


#Python example - more in docs
from portkey_ai import Portkey

portkey = Portkey(
    api_key="PORTKEY_API_KEY",
    virtual_key="YOUR_NEW_VIRTUAL_KEY_SLUG"
)

# Use portkey for all your API requests
response = portkey.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)

Hi FARIS,
Crunched some data & calculated some 
actual
 
results
 that Portkey users are seeing:
On answering user questions via LLMs, as high as 
60%  questions could be redundant
. Serving them from a 
semantic cache
 makes your app 
20x faster
 and 
costs you 
ZERO tokens
!
LLM API requests often get rate-limited, timeout or just fail. Using 
automatic exponential retries
 can 
lower your error rate from ~8% to ~0.2%
.
Azure’s OpenAI latencies generally have been 
~30% faster
 than OpenAI themselves, which makes these 2 great candidates to set up as 
fallbacks
.
quick question - found the analytics & logs worthwhile so far?

When someone dies in their sleep, people assume that that's the best way to die. But I'd say about 99% of the time, they feel themselves dying even in their sleep, and they struggle to breathe, and they actually die from suffocation. Is this likely?

Hey Faris!
 
We’ve made a few updates to our 
Community Guidelines
 – nothing brand new, just making things clearer so you know what’s OK (and what’s definitely not). 
Here’s a quick look at what’s changed:




Same rule, new location – you can only have one Tinder account at a time. 


We’ve added a reminder that if someone asks you to send money or invest in something, it’s probably a scam.


It’s never OK to target or report someone based on their identity – and we’ve added more detail about who that includes. 


We’ve added guidance around privacy – it’s OK to talk to friends or family about someone you’re meeting, but don’t share their personal info publicly. 


The same guidelines apply when you’re speaking with Tinder support or anyone at Match Group. 



 
By continuing to use Tinder after 
21 May 2025
, you’re agreeing to abide by these rules. 
 Thanks for ke

Hi Faris, 👋




Happy Thursday! Welcome to another edition of Mosh Bytes. 




This week, I’m sharing some time management tips that have made a huge difference in my productivity over the years. These aren’t just generic tips – they come straight from my personal experience as a developer. This is the exact routine I practice every day to stay focused and productive.




1. Start Your Day with a To-Do List


Begin your day with a list of tasks. This list serves as your map for the rest of the day. Without this map, it's easy to get lost in thousands of lines of code, and by the end of the day, you might w

Hello,
  
Today, we’re introducing 
Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4
, setting new standards for coding, advanced reasoning, and AI agents.
 
Here’s what we’re launching on the Anthropic API:
 
Claude Opus 4
: The world’s best coding model, with sustained performance on complex, long-running tasks and agent workflows.
 
Claude Sonnet 4
: A significant upgrade to Claude Sonnet 3.7, surpassing its predecessor across coding and reasoning while responding more precisely to your instructions.
 Extended thinking with tool use (beta)
:
 
Both models can use tools during extended thinking, allowing Claude to alternate between reasoning and tool use to improve responses.
 New model capabilities
:
 
When given local file access, both models can now extract and save key facts from conversations into local 'memory files,' maintaining continuity across sessions and build
